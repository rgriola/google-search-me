## Test Plan: Photo Upload Forms Consistency

### üéØ Objective
Ensure both save-location-form and edit-location-form use the same photo upload logic without breaking each other.

### üîß System Components Being Tested

1. **LocationPhotoManager** (Instance Methods)
   - `handlePhotoFile(event, mode)`
   - `processPhotoFiles(files, mode)` 
   - `addPhotoPreview(src, file, mode)`
   - `uploadPendingPhotos(pendingPhotos, placeId)`

2. **Global Photo Arrays**
   - `window.pendingPhotos` (for save form)
   - `window.pendingEditPhotos` (for edit form)

3. **Event Delegation** (LocationEventManager)
   - File input change events
   - Drop zone click events
   - Form submission with photo upload

4. **Form Setup** (LocationFormManager)
   - Photo upload initialization
   - Drag and drop setup

### üìã Test Cases

#### Test Case 1: Save Form Photo Upload
- **Setup**: Open save-location-dialog
- **Action**: Add photos via file input or drag/drop
- **Expected**: Photos appear in preview, added to `window.pendingPhotos`
- **Verification**: Form submission uploads photos to new location

#### Test Case 2: Edit Form Photo Upload  
- **Setup**: Open edit-location-dialog for existing location
- **Action**: Add photos via file input or drag/drop
- **Expected**: Photos appear in preview, added to `window.pendingEditPhotos`
- **Verification**: Form submission uploads photos to existing location

#### Test Case 3: Form Isolation
- **Setup**: Open both forms sequentially
- **Action**: Add photos to each form
- **Expected**: Photos in each form remain separate
- **Verification**: Save form uses `pendingPhotos`, edit form uses `pendingEditPhotos`

#### Test Case 4: Photo Array Cleanup
- **Setup**: Complete form submission with photos
- **Action**: Submit form successfully
- **Expected**: Respective pending array is cleared after upload
- **Verification**: No photo data leaks between forms

### üöÄ Implementation Details

#### Shared Photo Upload Logic
Both forms use the same underlying `LocationPhotoManager` methods:

```javascript
// Same for both 'save' and 'edit' modes
LocationPhotoManager.handlePhotoFile(event, mode)
LocationPhotoManager.addPhotoPreview(src, file, mode)
LocationPhotoManager.uploadPendingPhotos(photosArray, placeId)
```

#### Mode-Specific Differences
```javascript
// Save mode
mode = 'save'
photoArray = window.pendingPhotos
elementIds = 'save-photo-file-input', 'save-photo-drop-zone', 'save-photo-preview'

// Edit mode  
mode = 'edit'
photoArray = window.pendingEditPhotos
elementIds = 'edit-photo-file-input', 'edit-photo-drop-zone', 'edit-photo-preview'
```

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria

1. ‚úÖ Both forms can upload photos without conflicts
2. ‚úÖ Photo previews work in both forms
3. ‚úÖ Drag and drop works in both forms
4. ‚úÖ Photo arrays remain separate between forms
5. ‚úÖ Photo arrays are cleaned up after successful submission
6. ‚úÖ ImageKit integration works for both forms
7. ‚úÖ No JavaScript errors when switching between forms

### üêõ Known Issues Fixed

1. **Parameter Order Bug**: Fixed `uploadPendingPhotos` parameter order
2. **Instance vs Static**: Ensured `LocationPhotoManager` is properly exposed as instance
3. **Array Initialization**: Added automatic initialization of pending photo arrays
4. **Form Setup**: Added photo upload setup to `LocationFormManager.setupFormEnhancements`
5. **Array Cleanup**: Added cleanup of pending arrays after successful upload
