# refactor plan
# This document outlines the refactor plan for the locations module in the JavaScript codebase.

# LOCATIONS REFACTOR PLAN
## üóÇÔ∏è Overview
The goal of this refactor is to improve the maintainability and performance of the locations module.

## üîç Current Issues
Reduce file size to 400 lines of code per file, up to 500 is acceptable if the file is working well.

Test as updates are made to ensure no functionality is broken.

Eliminate redundant code and improve readability.

Before replacing code, ensure new code is well-tested and documented, and functions and parameters names are kept consistent and work with the existing codebase.  Do not write new functions if existing functions can be reused, again ensure existing functions are well-tested and documented.
