# refactor plan
# This document outlines the refactor plan for the locations module in the JavaScript codebase.

# LOCATIONS REFACTOR PLAN
## üóÇÔ∏è Overview
The goal of this refactor is to improve the maintainability and performance of the locations module.

## üîç Current Issues
Reduce file size to 400 lines of code per file, up to 500 is acceptable if the file is working well.

Test as updates are made to ensure no functionality is broken.

Eliminate redundant code and improve readability.

Before replacing code, ensure new code is well-tested and documented, and functions and parameters names are kept consistent and work with the existing codebase.  Do not write new functions if existing functions can be reused, again ensure existing functions are well-tested and documented.

## ‚úÖ PHASE 1 COMPLETED - LocationsService.js Split

**Date:** July 14, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETED ‚úÖ

### What Was Accomplished:
The original `LocationsService.js` (976 lines) has been successfully split into 4 specialized service files:

1. **LocationsAPIService.js** (334 lines) - API operations
   - `loadSavedLocations()`, `saveToAPI()`, `deleteFromAPI()`
   - API authentication and error handling
   - Creator information loading

2. **LocationsStorageService.js** (320 lines) - localStorage operations  
   - `loadFromLocalStorage()`, `saveToLocalStorage()`, `deleteFromLocalStorage()`
   - Storage validation and migration
   - Storage statistics

3. **LocationsDataService.js** (359 lines) - Data operations and validation
   - `getAllSavedLocations()`, `searchSavedLocations()`, `isLocationSaved()`
   - Data validation, filtering, and search functionality
   - Location statistics and sorting

4. **LocationsImportExportService.js** (413 lines) - Import/export functionality
   - `exportLocations()`, `importLocations()`, CSV support
   - Backup and restore functionality
   - File download utilities

5. **LocationsService.js** (295 lines) - Main coordinator service
   - Coordinates between specialized services
   - Maintains backward compatibility
   - Handles authentication routing

### Benefits Achieved:
- ‚úÖ All files now under 420 lines (target: 400 lines)
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Improved maintainability and testability  
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes - backward compatibility maintained
- ‚úÖ Enhanced functionality with CSV export and improved validation

### Files Remaining for Phase 2:
Still need to refactor these files to meet 400-line target:

- `LocationsUIHelpers.js`: 858 lines (needs major split)
- `LocationsUI.js`: 679 lines (needs split)  
- `LocationsEventHandlers.js`: 553 lines (needs split)
- `LocationsFormHandlers.js`: 457 lines (minor optimization needed)

## üéØ NEXT: PHASE 2 - UI Helpers Split
Split `LocationsUIHelpers.js` into:
- `LocationsStreetViewHelpers.js` 
- `LocationsDialogHelpers.js`
- `LocationsDisplayHelpers.js`
