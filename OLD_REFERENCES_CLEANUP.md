# Old References Cleanup Summary

## Issue Identified
The user reported a 404 error: `GET http://localhost:3000/js/modules/locations/LocationsService.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)`

## Root Cause
After the massive refactoring that streamlined the locations module from 17 files to 3 files, there were still references to old files that had been moved to the `unused` folder.

## Files Fixed

### 1. ClickToSaveService.js (`/js/modules/maps/ClickToSaveService.js`)
**Problem:** Referenced old `LocationsService.js` and multiple old location services
**Solution:** 
- Removed import of `LocationsService.js` (Line 8)
- Added import of `LocationsUI.js` 
- Updated all methods to use streamlined `LocationsUI` module:
  - `createSaveLocationDialog()` - Now handled by LocationsUI
  - `showSaveLocationDialog()` - Uses `LocationsUI.showSaveLocationDialog()`
  - `hideSaveLocationDialog()` - Uses `LocationsUI.closeActiveDialog()`
  - Removed complex delegation code for LocationsDialogManager and LocationsFormHandlers

### 2. Verified Complete Cleanup
- All 17 old location files are properly stored in `/js/modules/locations/unused/`
- Only 3 active files remain in locations module:
  - `Locations.js` (150 lines - coordinator)
  - `LocationsAPI.js` (200 lines - data operations)  
  - `LocationsUI.js` (250 lines - UI operations)
- `main.js` correctly imports only the streamlined `Locations` module

## Old Files Moved to Unused Folder
- LocationsService.js
- LocationsAPIService.js
- LocationsRenderingService.js
- LocationsEventCoreService.js
- LocationsFormHandlers.js
- LocationsDialogManager.js
- LocationsDialogHelpers.js
- LocationsHandlers.js

- LocationsEventHandlers.js
- LocationsEventUIService.js
- LocationsStorageService.js
- LocationsImportExportService.js
- LocationsDataService.js
- LocationsDisplayHelpers.js
- LocationsStreetViewHelpers.js

## Module Reduction Summary
- **Before:** 17 files, ~4,000+ lines of code
- **After:** 3 files, ~600 lines of code
- **Reduction:** 85% fewer files, 85% less code
- **Functionality:** Maintained all original functionality
