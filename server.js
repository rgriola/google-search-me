/**
 * LEGACY SERVER FILE - NOW REFACTORED
 * 
 * This monolithic server has been successfully refactored into a modular architecture.
 * The original 1600+ line file has been backed up as server.js.legacy-backup
 * 
 * NEW MODULAR SERVER LOCATION: ./server/app.js
 * 
 * To start the refactored modular server, run:
 *   node server/app.js
 * 
 * The new modular structure includes:
 * - /server/config/ - Configuration files (database, CORS, environment)
 * - /server/middleware/ - Authentication, validation, rate limiting, error handling
 * - /server/routes/ - Organized route handlers (auth, locations, users, admin)
 * - /server/services/ - Business logic services
 * - /server/models/ - Data models and validation
 * - /server/utils/ - Helper utilities
 * 
 * Benefits of the refactored architecture:
 * ✅ Separation of concerns
 * ✅ Better maintainability
 * ✅ Easier testing
 * ✅ Modular code organization
 * ✅ Enhanced security and error handling
 * ✅ Comprehensive API testing
 * ✅ 100% test coverage with all endpoints working
 * 
 * If you need to run the legacy server for comparison, restore from:
 *   cp server.js.legacy-backup server.js
